Hi, I'm Sahana

I work at the intersection of data operations and workflow optimization. My experience involves managing large-scale data lifecycles, validating structured processes, improving efficiency through automation, and ensuring accuracy in high-risk environments.
I am currently transitioning toward Product Analytics, where I aim to combine systems thinking, data validation, and structured problem-solving to improve user and business outcomes.
